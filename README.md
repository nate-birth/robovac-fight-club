What it is:

	RFC is a Forum based app that gives users a means of communication towards the sport of robot vacuum arena fighting. On the front it is a game based on specific rules dedicated to the safe “combat” of two robot vacuums utilizing a pin and a balloon.  The forums allow users to commu8nicate about different aspects of the sport including how to's, accessories, modifications, and buy/sell/trade.  On the secret side, the forums and features expand, to users that are deemed “trustworthy”.  Once a specific password and place of code is entered, a user becomes elite and gains access to secret forum channels to set up “underground” meet ups for more “dangerous” combat for these robot vacuums that could cause damage to them. It also opens up a new rule set, “underground” purchases, and more.
